# Publishing

We use *Poetry* to build and publish the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
The Carpentries provide a comprehensive [introduction to packaging with Poetry](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/43-software-release/index.html).

Ideally, we would want to set up a continuous integration workflow using Github Actions, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-python-poetry-package).
